    The willow, it weeps today <br />
    A breeze from the distance
    <br />
    Is calling your name
    <br />
    Unfurl your black wings and wait
    <br />
    Across the horizons
    <br />
    It's coming to sweep you away
    <br />
    It's coming to sweep you away
    <br />
    Let the wind carry you home
    <br />
    Blackbird, fly away
    <br />
    May you never be broken again
    <br />
    The fragile can not endure
    <br />
    They're wrecked and jaded
    <br />
    A place so impure
    <br />
    The static of this cruel world
    <br />
    Cause some birds to fly
    <br />
    Long before they've seen their day
    <br />
    Long before they've seen their day
    <br />
    Let the wind carry you home
    <br />
    Blackbird, fly away
    <br />
    May you never be broken again
    <br />
    Beyond the suffering you've known
    <br />
    I hope you find your way
    <br />
    May you never be broken again
    <br />
    Ascend, may you find no resistance
    <br />
    Know that you made such a difference
    <br />
    And all you leave behind
    <br />
    Will live til the end
    <br />
    The cycle of suffering goes on
    <br />
    But the memories of you stay strong
    <br />
    Some day I too will fly
    <br />
    And find you again
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Let the wind carry you home
    <br />
    Blackbird, fly away
    <br />
    May you never be broken again
    <br />
    Beyond the suffering you've known
    <br />
    I hope you find your way
    <br />
    May you never be broken again
    <br />
    May you never be broken again
    <br />
